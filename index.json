    "keywords": "Entity Setup Overview In CAF, an Entity refers to objects that take in input (weither it be from the player or from AI) to decide what state it should be in/transition into. It has helpers for physics force handling, combat related task such as hitbox creation and attack processing, and other various methods. All of these combine to create an Entity, which will usually be either a player controlled character or an enemy. Here we'll walk through the components required for a entity along with what they do. GameObject Setup First let's set up the GameObject that will contain all our scripts. Create a GameObject and attach a collider and a Rigidbody (or whatever you use to control the character's forces, such as a Character Controller ). Turn off the Rigidbody's gravity and set it's Angular Drag to 0. It should look like this. For the model or sprite of the Entity, you should assign it as a child of this GameObject. You should end up with a hierarchy like so."

Unity Package Manager To install this framework with the package manager, use this URL (replacing vX.X.X with the version you want): https://github.com/christides11/Character-Action-Framework.git#upm/vX.X.X Download Download the repository (either by cloning it or downloading as a zip) and put the CAF folder in your project. Delete the Samples folder if you don't need it."

    "keywords": "Setup Implement Classes First, you should create scripts that inherit from the ones listed below. These classes contain methods that you'll want to override depending on your game's needs, so it's important to do this now instead of potentially having to switch out the CAF component later. @CAF.Simulation.SimObjectManager @CAF.Entities.EntityState Entity Managers (Basically anything under @\"CAF.Entities\") AttackDefinition MovesetDefinition Run the Simulation In CAF, every object that exist in the game depends on the SimObjectManager. This script handles the creation and tracking of these objects, along with calling their update methods and simulating physics. Because of this, the next thing we want to do is create an instance of this class somewhere, perferably when your game is in the state where you want to instantiate the player's character and other stage elements. simulationObjectManager = new SimObjectManager(); Once you do that, you want to call these two every fixed update. public void FixedUpdate(){ simulationObjectManager.Update(Time.fixedDeltaTime); simulationObjectManager.LateUpdate(Time.fixedDeltaTime); } With that, the simulation should run, but right now we have nothing in the simulation. In the next step we'll walk through the components of a entity and show how to add objects to the simulation. Side Note: Physics SimObjectManager defaults to updating 3D Physics. If you're using 2D Physics, you'll want to override the SimulatePhysics method like so. protected override void SimulatePhysics(float deltatime){ Physics2D.Simulate(deltatime); } Side Note: Tick Rate since the simulation is ticked every fixed update, how often the simulation updates depends on the value of Fixed Timestep . By default it's set to 0.02, which translates to a tick rate of 50 times a second (0.02 = 1/50). Most action games target a tick rate of 60 times a second, so you may want to change the value to 0.01666667 (~1/60). You also might want to make the Maximum Allowed Timestep something like 0.02 for reasons explained here ."
